# üõ∞Ô∏è Decision Support System for Drone Management

This project presents a **Decision Support System (DSS)** designed to optimize the management of drones for ports. It provides **data-driven insights** to assist operators in making informed decisions about **drone deployment, maintenance scheduling, and route planning** based on real-time and historical data.

The goal is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure safety in various drone applications, such as surveillance, delivery, agriculture, and emergency response.

## üìä Project Overview

The system integrates **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and **rule-based logic** to support key decision-making processes. It relies on historical mission data, environmental factors, and drone performance metrics to generate recommendations.

This intelligent tool supports operators in both **routine missions** and **critical scenarios** where rapid and reliable choices are crucial.
